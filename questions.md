<h2>Write about how you plan to use what you learned in this lesson to improve your CPT project.</h2>
<!--<p>ANSWER</p>-->
<p> I have learned that there is SO MUCH that you are able to do with CSS, bootstrap, and Javascript than I ever thought. Fastpages is definitely a bit limiting with this, but with separate HTML projects, you can do a lot of customizing. For my CPT project, I can make it much more pleasing to the user's eye and make it much easier/cooler to use.

<h1>Customization 1</h1>

<h2>1. What are some of the best practices for creating effective wire-frames in computer science? How do wire-frames help with the design process?</h2>
<!--<p>ANSWER</p>-->
<p> Some of the best practices for creating effective wire-frames in computer science include using icons and considering interactivity and accessibility. Wire-frames are extremely useful for the design process because they allow designers to plan the layout and interaction of an interface. They can also consider all user features and experiences in an efficient way.
</p>
<h2>2. How does user testing play a role in the design of user interfaces and wire-frames in computer science? Can you provide an example of a project where user testing significantly impacted the final product design?</h2>
<!--<p>ANSWER</p>-->
<p> Testing the design of user interfaces is extremely important to see how users of different groups are able to use the platform. For example, people who aren't as familiar with computers may have a harder time using a website that isn't very clear with where to click and how to navigate through links. User testing allows for designers to make edits on how to make an interface easier to use and look better. An example of a project where user testing significantly impacted the final design was Microsoft's facial recognition. When testing, they realized that the AI did not recognize darker faces. This allowed them to edit the software before putting out the final design.

<h2>1. What is Bootstrap and how is it useful n developing websites?</h2>
<!--<p>ANSWER</p>-->
<p> Bootstrap is a free open source CSS framework that allows us to develop fast responsive front end for our website. Basically, bootstrap is an efficient and simple way to design an interface that a user interacts with.
</p>
<h2>2. What are the benefits of using Bootstrap in web development compared to css?</h2>
<!--<p>ANSWER</p>-->
<p>Some benefits of using Bootstrap include bootstrap's support on all browsers, bootstrap's responsive CSS to different formats, and its consistency.</p>
<h2>3. How can you include Bootstrap in YOUR website development?</h2>
<!--<p>ANSWER</p>-->
<p>I can include bootstrap in my website development to make it more user friendly. I can create image carossels, buttons, modals, and more. I can make my website more aesthetic as well.
<h2>4. What do selectors do? Explain one selector in your own words.</h2>
<!--<p>ANSWER</p>-->
<p> CSS selectors are used to "find" the HTML elements you want to style. For example, when you have multiple buttons, you can make one styling more important for that one to use. The "p.center" selector will only style "p" elements that are centered. </p>

<h1>JavaScript</h1>

<h2>1. What are examples of selection, iteration, and sequencing in the snake game?</h2>
<!--<p>ANSWER</p>-->
<p> In the snake game, selection is used when "if" statements are used. Selection is used when the apple and snake's positions are taken in account for. "If" the positions are the same, the user earns a point.
Iteration is used when the game loops through each of the snake's cells until the whole snake is taken accounted for. 
Sequencing is used when the code is run due to its specific order.
<h2>2. How does ":root" contribute to the customization of the game?</h2>
<!--<p>ANSWER</p>-->
<p>:root is called from CSS. It is responsible for setting values such as the color of the snake and apple.</p>
<h2>3. Write 2-3 sentences about how the use of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS creates the final product.</h2>
<!--<p>ANSWER</p>-->
<p> HTML is used to construct the entire project. Javascript, bootstrap, and CSS are used to create the website's features and design how it looks. Javascript is used for functionality of the game on this website.</p>
